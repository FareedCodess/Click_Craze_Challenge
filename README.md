# Click_Craze_Challenge
The Click Craze Challenge is an interactive and fast-paced game where the player's
objective is to click falling objects on a board to accumulate points. The game
features objects of different values falling from the top of the screen, and the player
must quickly click on these objects before they leave the board. The game keeps
track of the player's score and displays the top 5 scores once the game is over. It
also displays a play again button for the player to keep playing.
